###Flight Navigation Project
Overview: 
The Flight Navigation Project is designed to enhance flight route planning and risk mitigation by utilizing a genetic algorithm to optimize flight paths. This project addresses various challenges encountered during flight navigation such as unavailable GPS signals, adverse weather conditions. It integrates real-time data to provide optimal routes, risk assessments, and alternative route suggestions to pilots, airlines, and airport authorities.
Features:
Real-time Data Collection: Gathers data from various sources to account for weather conditions, electronic system status, and other environmental factors.
Genetic Algorithm: Implements a genetic algorithm to determine the best possible route between the start and end points.
Obstacles in the path: Identifies and avoids potential risks along the flight path.
Dynamic Route Planning: Allows dynamic input for start and end points to provide flexible and adaptive route planning.
Visualization: Graphical representation of the route, including obstacles and the final path.
Tech Stack
Python: Core programming language.
Libraries:
numpy: For numerical operations.
matplotlib: For visualization.
requests: For API requests.
json: For handling JSON data.
APIs:
OpenWeatherMap API
